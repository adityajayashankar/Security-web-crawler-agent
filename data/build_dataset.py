build_dataset.py  (FIXED + CORRELATION-FIRST)
----------------------------------------------
FIXES in this version:
  1. GitHub lookup: 3000 advisories crawled → only 149 in lookup map
     Root cause: old build_github_lookup only indexed by primary cve_id.
     Since 95% of GHSA advisories only have a ghsa_id (no primary cve_id),
     they were silently dropped. Fixed to index by ALL CVE aliases + ghsa_id.

  2. Training pair quality: no filtering → noisy short outputs in dataset
     Added filter_training_pairs() — drops outputs < 80 chars
     Added dedup_training_pairs()  — deduplicates by (instruction, output[:200])

  3. Training pair enrichment: L1 outputs were just field concatenations
     Now includes reasoning text to teach the model to analyse, not recite.

  4. CORRELATION-FIRST ARCHITECTURE (NEW)
     Correlation and co-occurrence pairs now target 60-65% of total dataset.
     This is the novelty of this dataset — the model learns:
       "Given CVE-X, what else is likely on the same system?"
       "Given OWASP A03, what co-occurs statistically?"
       "Given CWE-89, what other weaknesses cluster here?"

     New pair generators added:
       to_owasp_cooccurrence_pairs()     — OWASP-grounded, fires for ALL records
       to_cwe_family_pairs()             — CWE cluster pairs, ~30% of records
       to_kev_correlation_pairs()        — KEV campaign co-exploitation pairs
       to_blog_cooccurrence_pairs()      — Blog-sourced CVE pairs, chains & campaigns
       to_correlation_training_pairs()   — EXPANDED: 5 templates (was 3)
